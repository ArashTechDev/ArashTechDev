- 👋 Hi, I’m Arashdeep Singh. 
- 👀 I’m interested in working in AI & ML, UX, and front-end development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, C++, and Javascript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects a newbie can work on. I don't mind the type of project I work on right now, as I'm trying to learn as much as I can. I'll try my best to help
